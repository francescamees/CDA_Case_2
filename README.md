Assess how undergoing the stress condition (i.e., the puzzle phase) affects participants’ emotional and physiological states

## Does exposure to the stress condition lead to systematic and interpretable changes in cluster membership across phases?

Our goal is to assess how undergoing the stress condition (i.e., the puzzle phase) affects participants’ emotional and physiological states. To investigate this, we fit a clustering model separately within each phase rest, stress, and recovery and track how participants move between clusters across phases. This approach is based on the assumption that each cluster captures a distinct, cohesive psychophysiological state. Observing consistent transitions (e.g., from a low-arousal cluster at rest to a high-arousal cluster during stress) would indicate that the task induces a measurable shift in internal state. Our central question is therefore: does exposure to the stress condition lead to systematic and interpretable changes in cluster membership across phases?
